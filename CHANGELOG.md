- Changed Laplace distribution implementation in `create_price_samples` and `get_pop` functions in support.py

## 1.3.1 (2024-09-27)

- discriminator="type" removed from strategy: list[StrategyLeg] = Field(..., min_length=1) in models.py, since
it was causing errors in new Pydantic versions.

## 1.3.0 (2024-09-13)

- Remove the deprecated `StrategyEngine` class (it remains commented in the code).
- Update the README.md file to reflect the current state of the library

## 1.2.1 (2024-06-03)

- Add 1 to `time_to_target` and `time_to_maturity` in `engine.py` to consider the target and expiration dates as  trading days in the calculations
- Change Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` directory to utilize the `run_strategy()` function for performing options strategy calculations, instead of using the `StrategyEngine` class (deprecated) 
- Correct the PoP Calculator notebook
- Change the name of variable `project_target_ranges` in `models.py` and `engine.py` to `profit_target_ranges`

## 1.2.0 (2024-03-31)

- Add functions to run engine

## 1.1.0 (2024-03-24)

- Refactor the engine's `run` method for readability
- Accept dictionary of inputs to `StratgyEngine` init

## 1.0.1 (2024-03-18)

## 1.0.0 (2024-03-11)

**BREAKING CHANGES**:
- Renamed strategy.py to engine.py and `Strategy` to `StrategyEngine`
- Using pydantic for input validation into `StrategyEngine`
- Outputs are now also a Pydantic model
- Delete `use_dates`, as Pydantic will handle either using dates or `days_to_target`
- Renamed functions to be PEP8 compliant, i.e. instead of `getPoP`, now is `get_pop`
- Deleted options_chain.py module

## 0.1.7 (2023-07-04)

- Initial commit with strategy engine and examples
